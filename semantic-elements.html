  <h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
  <h2>DC Heroes</h2>
  <p><em>DC superheroes are the best.</em><br>
    The storylines are more complex, and <u>often address real life social issues.</u> My favorite is <strong>Green Arrow.</strong></p>
  <h3><small>Marvel heroes or whatever</small></h3>
  <p><q>Marvel superhero comics feel more 2-dimensional.</q> However, Marvel is really killing it in the film and TV, industries, whereas DC attempts to capitalize on the TV and file industries are more mediocre.</p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>But they do have decent moveis and TV shows for whatever that's worth.</p>
  <blockquote>To summerize, Marvel heroes are not as cool as DC heroes.</blockquote>
